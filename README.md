# scicode-learn
:star2: Welcome! :star2:

The goal of `scicode-learn` is to be an aggregation website for scientific programming resources. The project is particularly geared towards intro-to-programming material and guides that are more field-specific (e.g., making psychology experiments, data analyses for genetics research, etc.). The website will aggregate resources, from cheatsheets to online courses, across Python, Matlab, and R.

scicode-learn a riff off of #scicode and scikit-learn. (See [this blog](https://medium.com/@cMadan/scicode-learn-collecting-thoughts-ff22443f3dda) for some thoughts on the original inspiration for the project).

The project is still early on, see the [Roadmap_initial.md](Roadmap_initial.md) for the plan to get the project off the ground.

## Why should I learn to program?
Reproducibility is an important facet of scientific research, but non-computational workflows are difficult to construct as reproducible pipelines. By having a better understanding of scientific programming, we hope that scientists will be better able to conduct their research and share their analysis methods with others.
