# Contributing

scicode-learn is still early on, so the overall framework needs to be laid out a bit more first ([see roadmap issue](https://github.com/scicode-learn/scicode-learn/issues/2)).

For now, reply to the roadmap or create a new issue with suggestions.

## Adding to the database

Contributing new resources to the database is very much appreciated! (Though the database structure isn't defined just yet though.)

## Improvements to the front-end interface

The front-end needs to be set-up first, but after that I'm sure some improvements can still be made!
